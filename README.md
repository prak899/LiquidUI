# üì± LiquidUI SDK ‚Äî Server-Driven UI Rendering Engine for Android (PhonePe-style)

## üöÄ Introduction

Welcome to the **LiquidUI SDK Demo**, a fully functional, production-grade Server Driven UI (SDUI) rendering engine designed for Android using Kotlin. This SDK allows an Android application to render complex and dynamic UIs directly from JSON configurations at runtime ‚Äî without requiring an app update. Inspired by **PhonePe‚Äôs dynamic home page architecture**, this demo brings real-world production-grade elements to life, such as:

- Dynamic Carousel (Auto-scroll + Dot indicators)
- Horizontally scrollable feature buttons
- Grid-based icon cards with padding, elevation, and shadows
- Full-width banners with overlay text
- Navigation via URL or Android Intents

---

## üéØ Objective

The purpose of this project is to showcase how to build a **Server-Driven UI system** (like PhonePe or Paytm) on Android using native Views (not Jetpack Compose), emphasizing flexibility, maintainability, and modular design. The key objectives achieved in this SDK include:

- Rendering complete home screens from JSON.
- Full Carousel implementation with auto-scrolling and dot indicators.
- Reusable Grid and List renderers supporting varying column and item counts.
- On-click actions driving URL opens or explicit navigation via Intents.
- Demonstration of real-world complex layouts ‚Äî not dummy screens.
- Clean, modular architecture enabling reuse and easy extension.

## üîß Features Implemented

1. **Server-Driven JSON UI:**
   - JSON read from `res/raw/liquid_ui.json` (can be changed to server fetch).
   - Parsed using Gson into data classes (`UIModel`).
   - Fully dynamic rendering based on JSON structure.

2. **Dynamic Carousel (PhonePe-like):**
   - ViewPager2-based.
   - Auto-scroll using Handler & Runnable.
   - Dot Indicator reflects carousel position.
   - On-click actions trigger Activity navigation via Intent.

3. **Grid Layout Rendering:**
   - Grid with adjustable column count.
   - Each item: CardView + elevation + padding + shadow + icon + text.
   - Real icons loaded via URL (Glide).
   - Click event shows Toast or navigates via Intent.

4. **Horizontal List Rendering:**
   - Circle icon buttons scrollable horizontally using RecyclerView.
   - Each item dynamically created from JSON.

5. **Banner Rendering:**
   - Full-width banner image.
   - Custom overlay text ("Prakash Majhi (Android Engineer)") centered.
   - Click action supports navigation.

6. **Event Handling:**
   - `"type": "navigate"` ‚Äî open web URL.
   - `"type": "navigate_intent"` ‚Äî open specific Activity via Intent.
   - Custom extras supported in Intent.

7. **Reusable & Extendable Architecture:**
   - Clean rendering logic via `LiquidUIRenderer`.
   - Easily add new UI types (e.g., rating cards, offer tiles).

8. **Indiaction**
   - Typically it indicates that a new UI has been introduce and it will apply this automatically.
